# Manpower-Acquisition-Planning-System

This project is designed and developed for any educational universities or colleges for making recruitment process. The system is designed by keeping in mind
both parties like colleges/universities and MNC companies. This system allows placement officers(Applicants) to register his/her details along with colleges/universities
details & to post the student's resumes based on the opportunities in the companies. And also job providers can post their requirements in the system. This makes the recruitment
system fast and easy as the existing system is a manual one. In this project there are different modules for each type of the user i.e. Company, University or any single user. The
company can enter their requirements and technologies they prefer. Similarly University can also specify the number of students which are eligible for the post by giving the 
information so that Company can easily checkout their resumes. I Have used separate jsp pages for each of the entries like for registration and login of each entities . And with each 
jsp page I have linked form bean class and java action class . I have also maintained session for each type of user which may provide security so that invalid user can't access the 
account . As I have made my project on struts, I have used tiles so that I can update the menus of the pages, by the help of tiles. As I have made one layout or different parts
of page like header, footer top menu and body. So, I can update the layout of different pages. There is a jdbc connectivity with MySql for maintaining the databases. There is a 
separate module for showing the result of recruitment process and Interviews which make it easier for the company and University to schedule their time. Thus, as a whole it will
renovate the lengthier present system with much effective and efficient mechanism of recruitment process.
